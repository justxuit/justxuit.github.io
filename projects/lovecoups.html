                        <p>At the beginning of 2017, LoveCoups lacked a mobile-friendly version of their website. As all customization of this
                            product is done from the site, they could not capitalize on the growing audience of users who primarily browse the
                            internet with mobile devices.</p>
                        <p>In choosing to rebrand and relaunch the LoveCoups website with a more modern, updated look and functionality, a mobile-first design was absolutely essential. In hopes of improving usage and accessibility across multiple platforms and devices, a more intuitive interface for all website traffic — mobile, desktop, and tablet - was also necessary.</p>

                    <h3>Updating ‘My Books’ to ‘My Home’</h3>
                    <p>In the original website, the ‘My Books’ page was used as a crossroads for users to access both their coupon books as
                    well as their characters. It soon became apparent that the ‘My Books’ page was the page most frequently linked to from
                    other pages. However, orders and account information were housed separately on additional pages. Since all coupon books,
                    both incomplete and previously purchased ones were all featured in the ‘My Books’ section, it made more sense to extend
                    ‘My Books’ to serve the more generalist purpose of an internal “homepage” for users to be able to access not only their
                    books and characters, but their order history and website account settings as well.</p>

                    <h3>Delineation of Primary and Secondary Content</h3>
                    <p>On the original website, there was a general lack of hierarchy with the navigation links on the main page. After
                    discussion with the company’s customer service team, it was discovered that placing page links to the FAQ and Shipping
                    pages first would sometimes distract or confuse new users, when ultimately getting them to sign up for a LoveCoups
                    account should always be the first step in the user flow. Once users were engaged in the process of creating their
                    avatar characters, they were much more likely to continue exploring the website’s features.</p>
                    <p>For this reason, less important content, such as the FAQ page, were relegated to a footer link. A ‘Get Started’ button
                    was added to the top-right corner of the landing page, serving as another path for users to reach the login/sign up
                    stage.</p>

                    <h3>Coupon Book Interactions</h3>
                    <p>As there were multiple possible interactions and states that any coupon book could have (e.g. incomplete, already
                    purchased, etc.) the challenge within the ‘My Books’ page was to present all this information in a way that was easily
                    understood by the user while at the same time encouraging them to complete the creation and purchasing processes. By
                    using descriptive icons and color-coded interactions (green for purchasing, teal for book editing-related options, and
                    red for warnings), portions of text could be parsed down to the bare essentials, allowing users to glean more
                    information quickly.</p>

                    <h3>Shipping Page</h3>
                    <p>For the company’s customer service team, customer questions regarding shipping was an issue they faced often. While the
                    original website had a small, information panel on shipping time calculations, it often varied wildly based on the
                    destination country. On the updated shipping page, an option was added to allow users to input their location first in order to see
                    anticipated shipping times. Shipping options were presented in a way that made shipping type comparisons much easier to
                    perform.</p>
