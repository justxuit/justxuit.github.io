From 2017 to 2019, I worked as a front end developer at a company called LoveBook. LoveCoups.com is LoveBook's sister
website that offers personalized, fully customizable printed coupon booklets.

At the beginning of 2017, LoveCoups lacked a mobile-friendly version of their website. As all customization of this
product is done from the site, they could not capitalize on the growing audience of users who primarily browse the
internet with mobile devices.

I was tasked with rebuilding the LoveCoups website based on branding guidelines and mockups provided by the LoveBook
graphics team. A mobile-first design was absolutely essential, as well as an updated, more intuitive interface for all
website traffic â€” mobile, desktop, and tablet.
