                    department — the administrative staff and faculty. Specifically, an internal file storage system (<strong>MBox</strong>) was implemented
                    by the IT staff for the department, but was underutilized by both the staff and faculty. Our team's goal was to
                    investigate the areas where breakdowns in usage were occurring and propose potential solutions to address this issue.</p>

                <p>Our team conducted <strong>8 semi-structured user interviews</strong> between October - November 2019 with <strong>3 stakeholder groups</strong>. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the client's issue at hand, we interviewed members of the department administrative staff, faculty members, and IT department staff. Interviews ranged from <strong>30 to 60 minutes</strong> and were
                conducted in-person in the interviewee's own work environment.</p>
                <p>With 24-48 hours after each interview, my team held interpretation sessions. We transcribed the interview and collected any significant feedback or observations found in the interview recording. Data collected included information such as: direct interviewee quotes, interviewer observations, and patterns/statistics that emerged throughout the interview process.</p>

However, these advantages may not currently be leveraged to their full potential due to low frequency of usage. Many individuals simply do not know that these features exist.</p>

                        the latest files on MBox, they are met with outdated files and are further deterred from using it, requesting
                        documentation from staff instead. These requests further reinforce the staff's assumption that faculty members do not
                        use MBox.</p>

                <p>During my team's solution evaluation process, all proposed solutions were analyzed and weighted based on characteristics
                our team felt were the most relevant to our client. Our judging criteria primarily focused on solutions that were:
                <strong>highly feasible</strong>, could <strong>increase self-sufficiency</strong> amongst staff and faculty members, and potentially <strong>improve the file uploading/downloading process</strong>, preferably both. Other factors that were considered were: the speed at which the solution
                could be implemented, the monetary cost of implementing the solution, and the existing familiarity that our interviewees
                expressed with the proposed solution.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, our team proposed the following solutions, organized into 3 categories:</p>

                <section class="no-padding">
                    <article class="lilac">
                        <h4>Updates & Improvements to the Existing System (MBox)</h4>
                        <p>Currently, the ideal purpose of the MBox is to house all documents related to the [client]. The scope of its usage may in fact be too broad, and attempting to provide a comprehensive cache of all files has in effect made organizing and retrieving individual files a complicated endeavor. The addition of a <strong>"Most Popular" folder</strong> located at the top of the MBox folder list would offer some incentive faculty to first check the MBox system for a file they might have directly requested from a staff member. This would be especially useful for instances where [client]'s staff receive multiple requests for similar/the same file from various faculty members.</p>
                        <p>A frequently noted observation was the lack of updates to files housed within MBox. From the data that our team collected, it became apparent that one of the potential contributing reasons for this phenomenon was the usage of multiple file-sharing services. For example, some documents are stored on both Google Drive and MBox, adding an unnecessary layer of redundancy whenever a staff member must update these documents. <strong>Box Sync</strong> is a tool that allows users to mirror data stored on Box to their local desktop. Once this synchronization feature is set up, users are able to browse and access files stored within MBox through their native file browsing interface.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article class="taupe">
                        <h4>Additional Training Protocols</h4>
                        <p>Currently, no official protocol for adding/uploading files to MBox exists. It is up to individual staff members to
                        organize files within the system in a meaningful way. Due to the lack of existence of a protocol, there is also no
                        documentation that can be shared amongst staff or faculty members that would help users to navigate the MBox folder
                        structure. In an effort to address the complexity and wide scope of files contained within MBox, some common
                        organizational structure and naming convention for folders and files need to be established. Files should follow a
                        specific naming pattern so as to be more easily located via the search function (for example:
                        budget_report_2019dec.pdf). Folder naming patterns should also be more descriptive and reflect the contents within.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article class="orange">
                        <h4>Alternative Services & Products</h4>
                        <p>As the general goal of improving the current file requests and retrieval process is to promote self-sufficiency within
                        faculty members, it would be beneficial to provide additional resources that the faculty can leverage to obtain specific
                        documents they may require without having to resort to specifically requesting it from a staff member. In our
                        interviews, the [client]'s website was widely regarded very positively amongst all interviewees. Some interviewees had
                        stated that, instead of MBox, they more often used the website as a resource. With this knowledge, our team recommends
                        that files whose contents are not dependent on privacy permissions and do not contain department-sensitive information
                        be made available on the [client] <strong>website</strong> itself, perhaps within a separate category titled "Resources." While contents
                        on the website may be limited due to access and security restrictions, simply providing another potential resource for
                        [client] personnel to leverage for information may help to reduce the occurrences of information requests that staff
                        members encounter.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>Google Drive</strong> service is one with which most of our interviewees were highly familiar. Amongst its many features
                        offered, its real-time collaborative capability was an aspect that many [client] personnel found to be useful. Its
                        search functionality was another tool that was regarded very positively amongst faculty members. Both of these notable
                        tools are areas in which the MBox falls short. In addition, Google Drive is already used within the department by some
                        individuals, though its adoption is not consistent across the department as a whole.</p>
