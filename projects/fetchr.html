                    <p>As a lifelong dog lover, it had always been a personal goal of mine to own one once I had the means to do so. While living in Baltimore, I landed my first "adult person" job after undergrad and quickly began to look up local shelters to find a future canine companion.</p>
                    <p>I quickly discovered that the dog adoption process a difficult and time-consuming one. There was no easy way to see exactly what kinds of dogs my local shelters had available — shelter websites were often outdated or incomplete. There was also no guarantee that a shelter would have dogs whose needs would fit my living situation and work schedule.</p>
                    <p><span class="emphasis">There should be a tool to make it easier for for people who want to adopt dogs from their local shelters to do so</span>, I thought.</p>
                    <p>So, I decided to make one.</p>

                    <p>Approximately <span class="emphasis">47%</span> of re-homed dogs were done so citing "problematic behaviors," which could be caused in part by a lack of the owners’ prior knowledge/experience in canine breed behaviors and training. Additionally, this focus on a dog’s readily observable aesthetics has ultimately resulted in the emergence of a related problem — overrepresentation of
                    less "popular" breeds within shelters, further perpetuating the stigma of these particular breeds as being
                    "un-adoptable."</p>
                    <p>Due to the relatively broad scope of this issue, it was necessary to limit the the geographical parameters of
                    research in order to better investigate the specific nuances of the problem at hand. Thus, the city of Baltimore was
                    chosen
                    specifically due to its particular history and legislation regarding dogfighting and pit bulls, one of the most
                    stigmatized types of dogs currently.</p>

This application aims to empower users to make informed decisions when selecting adoption candidates that are better suited to their own lifestyles.</p>
                <p>To begin addressing the issue, I initially started with sketches of 8 potential solutions. I included both digital and
                non-digital solutions to avoid restricting ideas prematurely. These ideas were then expanded upon using storyboards to
                flesh out their respective pros and cons. Ultimately, I wanted to explore in detail how the strengths of each particular
                solution might be incorporated into other ideas.</p>

                lifestyle and presents this information in a way that is relevant, informative, and memorable.</p>

                        <li>In general, it seemed that <strong>users valued visual elements that would allow them to make more informed decisions</strong> — for example, knowing how many potential matches fit according to their questionnaire responses gave users a good idea of how <em>each</em> response directly impacted their results.</li>
                        <li>Users did not see much value in the match percentage feature. There were questions raised as to how each response factored into the final calculation, as well as general confusion over "how much" percentage discrepancies mattered. Overall, <strong>they found the metric itself to be too arbitrary and vague to be helpful</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Lastly, users expressed general apprehension while going through the questionnaire. Some assumed that the answers provided were irreversible (and therefore a user would have to re-take the entire questionnaire if they wanted to later update their preferences). Others were worried that their lack of experience and knowledge would lead them to choose a response that would ultimately not be an accurate representation of what they wanted. With all of these concerns, it seemed <strong>many users wanted a way to easily modify their questionnaire responses</strong>.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>I realized that could look to finding #1 to address the issues brought up in findings #2 and #3 and provide solutions that would leverage an aspect of the design that users had already found valuable.</p>

                    <p>The biggest challenge in this regard was to find a way to <em>show</em> users how a percentage match translated to a breakdown of their own preferences. Ultimately, I opted to add a <strong>radar chart</strong> to the dogs' detailed profile pages, as all of the questions presented to the user could be sorted into one of five categories – size, energy, trainability, shedding, and barking.</p>

This meant that they would never be required re-take the questionnaire in its entirety, as users had indicated during the user testing phase that although the questionnaire was thorough, they also found it to be somewhat long and requiring some effort to complete.</p>
                    <p>I decided to add a <strong>detailed preferences submenu</strong> in the match results screen to allow users to both view and update their saved questionnaire responses.</p>
